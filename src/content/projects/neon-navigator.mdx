## Overview
Designed level flow and encounter pacing. Implemented laser fire with energy constraints and feedback.

## What I worked on
- Level pacing and encounter sequencing  
- Weapon loop with energy use and recharge  
- UI and basic VFX for feel

## Tech notes
- ScriptableObjects for tunables  
- Simple state machine for player actions
