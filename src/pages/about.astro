      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I study computer science at Cal Poly Pomona, and have an interest in Game Development. I've done multiple projects in Unity and Unreal Engine, 
        and have real world experience, having interned 2 consecutive summers at 505 Games in Milan, Italy. Below is a timeline including projects that I've done,
        and relevant experiences that I have participated in.
